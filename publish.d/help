Usage: ici [OPTIONS] publish OUTDIR

Publishes the information that the public needs to know about this
certificate authority, such as the root certificate, the certificate
revokation list and the list of issued certificates.

OUTDIR must be given and is the directory in which the information is
stored as a web page.

You will have to make sure that your web server knows to serve OUTDIR.

*Notes*
You should generate the certificate revokation list before running this
command.  See 'ici help gencrl'.
